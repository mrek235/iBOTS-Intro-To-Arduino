// Development Plan: Commit the code each time a step is completed.
// [ ] Write and build the boilerplate code for Arduino (#include<Arduino.h>, setup(), loop())
// [ ] Open the simulator
// [ ] Make the red LED flash on and off once every 50 milliseconds.
// [ ] Make the red LED flash on and off only if one of the buttons is being pressed.
// [ ] Turn on an LED when the button of a corresponding color is held down.
// [ ] The blue LED should be different; it should turn off when its button is pressed, not on.
// [ ] The green LED should be a switch; when its button is pressed, it should change from staying on to staying off, then go back the next time it's pressed.
// [ ] When the red button is pressed, it should turn on for a couple of seconds, then automatically turn back off.
// [ ] All buttons' LEDs should respond as soon as they are pressed.
